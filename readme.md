# YAREN 

YAREN stands for "Yet another rendering engine" (Couldn't think of a better name ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
* Started as a playground project, it currently acts as an API for rendering, basic shaders, textures and displaying images.
* Current entry point ([application.cpp](https://github.com/Anshul7sp1/YAREN/blob/master/src/Application.cpp)) of the application is set to a menu of different tests that can be used to check the engine.
* Uses IMGui as a gui to select and control different options.
